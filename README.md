# 📂 Data Format Extraction & Analysis Toolkit

This project demonstrates how to load, preview, and work with a variety of data file types in Python.  
It was originally developed as an exercise for a graduate-level data science course.

---

## 📌 Objective

Using a custom utility module, this notebook loads and previews:

- 🖼️ Image file (`atlas.png`)
- 📊 Excel file (`Financial Sample.xlsx`)
- 📄 CSV file (`ElectionsCanada.csv`)
- 🌐 HTML table (`World GDP by Country`)
- 🧾 JSON file (`pokedex.json`)
- 🗃️ SQLite database (`chinook.db`)

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- File I/O with `pandas`, `json`, and `sqlite3`
- Custom Python utility function design (`Data Extraction Utility.py`)
- Exploratory previews using `DataFrame.head()`, `iloc`, etc.
- Clean modular code structure

| File                              | Description                            |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `Data Extraction.ipynb`           | The main notebook                      |
| `Data Extraction Utility.py`      | Helper functions for file loading      |
| `data/`                       | Folder containing all test data files  |
| `README.md`                       | Project documentation (this file)      |

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Place the entire `data` folder in the same directory as the notebook
2. Ensure `Data Extraction Utility.py` is in the same folder
3. Run the notebook using Jupyter or VS Code with Python support

## 💬 Notes

> This notebook shows my understanding of real-world data handling using Python across formats. It is used as part of a portfolio to demonstrate file parsing and modular code design.
